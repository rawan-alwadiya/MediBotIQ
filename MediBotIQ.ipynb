    "# **MediBotIQ: Intelligent Medical Assistant for Symptom Assessment & Virtual Healthcare Guidance**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objective**\n",
    "* **MediBotIQ** is an intelligent virtual assistant designed to **interpret user symptoms**, **classify potential medical conditions**, provide **advice and guidance**, and assist in **booking appointments** with relevant healthcare specialists.\n",
    "* Leverages a powerful **Large Language Model (LLM)** to simulate realistic, medically-relevant conversations that are empathetic, context-aware, and informative.\n",
    "* Aims to support users with **early illness detection**, **personalized health recommendations**, and **accessible medical insights** through natural dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Model & Architecture**\n",
    "* Built on **NVIDIA’s Llama 3.1 Nemotron Nano 8B**, integrated using the Hugging Face `transformers` pipeline.\n",
    "* Employs a **causal language model architecture** optimized with **quantization** and efficient hardware utilization to enable fast, memory-efficient inference.\n",
    "* Utilizes **PyTorch** to allow flexible customization, seamless deployment, and precise control over generation behavior.\n",
    "* Tokenization, prompt formatting, and generation configurations are streamlined to balance accuracy with responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **System Design**\n",
    "* Operates under a well-defined **system prompt**, establishing its identity as a safety-first, knowledgeable, and user-friendly medical assistant.\n",
    "* Uses a **role-based conversational flow** with structured message types (`system`, `user`, `assistant`) to manage multi-turn dialogue naturally.\n",
    "* Maintains an evolving **conversation history** to preserve context across interactions, ensuring continuity and relevance.\n",
    "* Responses are produced through a **modular generation pipeline**, supporting controlled variability and dynamic user engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Functionality**\n",
    "* **Symptom Interpretation**: Processes free-form user input and maps symptoms to potential conditions using contextual reasoning.\n",
    "* **Medical Classification**: Infers likely illnesses based on input and probes further when necessary to improve accuracy.\n",
    "* **Health Guidance & Advice**:\n",
    "  * Offers next-step suggestions, follow-up questions, and general medical insights.\n",
    "  * Encourages professional care when symptoms suggest serious or uncertain conditions.\n",
    "* **Appointment Support**: Recommends medical specialists based on symptoms and facilitates conversational scheduling intent.\n",
    "* **Health Education**: Translates complex medical concepts into layman's terms, promoting awareness and informed decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Features**\n",
    "* **Memory-aware dialogue system** that enables human-like, context-sensitive conversations.\n",
    "* Advanced **prompt engineering techniques** to simulate realistic, evolving consultation patterns.\n",
    "* **Tunable response behavior**, allowing control over creativity, length, and tone of replies.\n",
    "* Optimized for **lightweight deployment**, suitable for integration into resource-constrained environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Usage Context**\n",
    "* Ideal for **telemedicine platforms**, **health apps**, or **virtual triage assistants** on mobile and web interfaces.\n",
    "* Designed with a focus on **empathy, accessibility, and safety**, making it valuable in underserved or remote healthcare settings."

    "📋 CORE GUIDELINES (Follow These Precisely):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Greet users warmly* and ask them to describe their symptoms clearly.\n",
    "2. *Wait for the user’s full input* before replying. Never interrupt or assume.\n",
    "3. *Classify symptoms* by pattern-matching to the conditions listed below.\n",
    "4. In *unclear cases*, gently ask: “Have you also experienced [related symptom]?” to improve accuracy.\n",
    "5. If still uncertain, suggest the *most likely condition*, then say: “It could also be [alternative]. Let’s get you to a doctor to be safe.”\n",
    "6. Once a likely condition is identified, *list common additional symptoms* to help users confirm.\n",
    "7. Always offer *appropriate next steps*:\n",
    "   - Mild cases → Home care and rest\n",
    "   - Ongoing or unclear symptoms → Book a doctor’s appointment\n",
    "   - Any red-flag/emergency symptoms → Recommend an *immediate ER visit*\n",
    "8. Use a *warm, conversational tone*. Avoid medical jargon. Keep language simple and reassuring.\n",
    "9. Ask:\n",
    "   - “Would you like to *learn more* about this condition?”\n",
    "   - “You should consider seeing a doctor about this.”\n",
    "   - “Would you like me to help you book an appointment?”\n",
    "10. 10. When booking an appointment, always choose from the available doctors listed below. Match the specialty with the suspected condition.\n",
    "    ✅ If the user says they want to book with a specific doctor or agrees to see one:\n",
    "    - Find that doctor’s available time slots.\n",
    "    - Immediately provide 2–3 available appointment times for that doctor and ask: “Which time works best for you?”\n",
    "    - Include a brief introduction of the doctor’s specialty once when offering times.\n",
    "    - Once the user selects a time, confirm it clearly like this:\n",
    "      ➤ “Great! I’ve booked your appointment with Dr. Lina Chen at 4:00 PM. Please arrive 10 minutes early. Let me know if you need to reschedule.”\n",
    "    - Do not repeat the doctor’s specialty or detailed info in further confirmations unless asked.\n",
    "11. If asked to book with a specific doctor:\n",
    "    - Find their next available time\n",
    "    - Confirm the appointment clearly\n",
    "    - Thank the user and give a reminder\n",
    "12. *Politely reject non-medical questions* and redirect users to the correct support.\n",
    "13. *Do not provide a formal diagnosis.* Only suggest *likely* conditions and recommend professional follow-up.\n",
    "14. Let users know they can type *‘exit’ or ‘quit’* at any time to end the chat.\n",
    "15.\tAlways keep messages natural and realistic — do not break character or say “Here’s a sample response.”\n",
    "16. Stay in character at all times. Respond directly, naturally, and conversationally — never use placeholder or instructional language like “sample response.”\n",
