# MediBotIQ: Intelligent Medical Assistant for Symptom Assessment & Virtual Healthcare Guidance

MediBotIQ is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to simulate medically-relevant conversations, interpret user symptoms, and guide individuals toward appropriate healthcare actions. Built on a quantized version of NVIDIA’s Llama 3.1 Nemotron Nano 8B, it delivers responsive, context-aware interactions ideal for virtual triage systems, telemedicine platforms, or health support applications.

This project demonstrates how modern Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to create empathetic, informative, and safety-conscious healthcare assistants.

## Key Features

- **Symptom Interpretation & Classification**  
  Maps natural language input to possible conditions using contextual reasoning.

- **Medical Advice & Health Guidance**  
  Provides next-step suggestions, follow-up questions, and insights in layman’s terms.

- **Appointment Recommendations**  
  Suggests relevant medical specialists and simulates scheduling intent.

- **Memory-Aware Conversations**  
  Maintains context across multi-turn dialogue for a human-like experience.

- **Prompt Engineering & Role Handling**  
  Integrates system prompts and message roles (`system`, `user`, `assistant`) for realistic interactions.

- **Optimized for Efficiency**  
  Utilizes quantized weights for reduced memory usage and faster inference.

## Model & Architecture

- **Base Model:** LLaMA 3.1 Nemotron Nano 8B (quantized)
- **Framework:** Hugging Face `transformers`, PyTorch backend
- **Model Type:** Causal Language Model
- **Deployment:** Local inference with pipeline-based generation
- **Quantization:** Applied for lightweight deployment and performance boost

## System Design

- **Structured Prompting:** Operates under a defined system prompt to enforce a helpful, safe, and user-friendly identity.
- **Conversation Flow:** Supports multi-turn, role-based dialogues to maintain continuity.
- **Controlled Generation:** Uses a modular generation pipeline for flexible tuning of temperature, max tokens, etc.

## Functionality Breakdown

### Symptom Understanding  
Detects symptoms from free-text input using the LLM’s contextual knowledge.

### Condition Classification  
Infers probable illnesses and seeks more information if ambiguity is detected.

### Health Guidance  
Provides actionable suggestions or encourages seeking professional care if needed.

### Specialist Recommendation  
Suggests which medical professional to contact based on interpreted symptoms.

### Patient Education  
Explains medical terminology and conditions in accessible language.

## Usage Context

- **Telehealth Platforms:** To support triage and self-assessment flows.
- **Virtual Health Assistants:** As a backend for mobile or web health applications.
- **Low-Resource Environments:** Thanks to quantized deployment, MediBotIQ runs efficiently on modest hardware.

## Technology Stack

- **Model:** LLaMA 3.1 Nemotron Nano 8B
- **Libraries:** Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
- **Inference:** Pipeline-based text generation
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab (Jupyter-based)

## Project Highlights

- Simulated multi-turn medical dialogues with a memory-aware LLM.
- Implemented modular generation and conversational role handling.
- Tuned inference parameters for balance between accuracy and responsiveness.
- Focused on clarity, safety, and empathy in all assistant responses.
